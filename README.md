Code repository for my manuscript submission titled:

**Assessment of Deep Learning and Monte Carlo-based MNDWI Ensemble for Enhanced Rapid and Spatial Probabilistic Water Extent Mapping under Dynamic Flow Conditions**

Submitted to *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*.

## Summary

Accurate surface water mapping in river–reservoir systems remains challenging due to mixed pixels, turbidity, cloud contamination, and variable water spectral behavior under rapidly varying inflows. Spectral index approaches often fail in transition zones due to manual thresholding problems, while deep learning models also struggle to generalize under dynamic hydrologic conditions.

This repository implements a probabilistic ensemble framework that integrates deep learning segmentation with Monte Carlo–based MNDWI pertubations to improve delineation under complex flow regimes. The framework was developed and tested over the Kainji Reservoir and flood events along the transboundary Niger River system.

## Environment

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
Deep learning inference relies on the ArcGIS Pro Python environment and ArcPy.

## Notes

- Large raster datasets are not included and must be supplied locally.
- File paths in scripts may require adjustment depending on the local setup.
- The repository is intended for research reproducibility and peer review.
